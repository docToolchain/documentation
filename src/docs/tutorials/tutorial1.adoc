= Tutorial: add docToolchain as submodule

// numbering from here on
:numbered:

This short tutorial will show you how to add docToolchain as git submodule.

== Motivation

Git submodules are references to a certain commit of another git repository.
This makes submodules perferct to include repositories -- on which your own project depends -- into your project without copying them.
Since a submodule is a pointer to a certain commit, it is also easy to update this pointer when a newer version is available.

== What you'll build

In this tutorial, you will create a simple gradle project with a single `.adoc` file.
To this project, you'll add docToolchain to generate an HTML file and a PDF.

== What you'll need

* 20(?) minutes
* a windows or *nix based machine
* a text editor or IDE
* jdk 1.8 installed
* git installed
* gradle installed

the commands needed to go through this tutorial will be bash based.
So if you are on a windows environment, please make sure that you start a bash
or translate the commands for yourself - I am sure this will be a no-brainer.

== Create a simple project to start with

create a new folder and switch to it

    mkdir tutorial1
    cd tutorial

init git (it's a new project!) and create a simple folder structure for your documents

    git init
    mkdir src
    mkdir src/docs

create a simple `.adoc` file.
To make it simple, just fetch one from the net via curl

    curl -o src/docs/test.adoc https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mojavelinux/4402636/raw/b8b02adc3c0ddb92df505ba3eb8e625952615b7a/test.asciidoc.txt

and since this great test document includes another document, let's fetch this also

    curl -o src/docs/include.asciidoc.txt https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mojavelinux/4402636/raw/b8b02adc3c0ddb92df505ba3eb8e625952615b7a/include.asciidoc.txt

The main file `./src/docs/test.adoc` contains a reference to a stylesheet which is not available, so please open it in your favourite editor (vi?) and remove the reference (`:stylesheet: asciidoc.css` in line 17)

    vi src/docs/test.adoc

Since we like Gradle projects, let's initialize the toplevel project (`tutorial1`) as gradle project.
This will make docToolchain a subproject.

    gradle init

and

    gradle wrapper

for convenience.
That's it!

.use the wrapper, luke!
****

Don't have gradle installed?

Just first add docToolchain as submodule (next step) and then do

    cd docToolchain
    ./gradlew -p .. init

 This will use the gradle wrapper contained in docToolchain to initialize your main project.

Alternativly use https://sdkman.io[sdkman]
****

For a real project, you now would add some source code and more build instructions.
To render the document with docToolchain, we only need the document itself.

== add docToolchain as submodule

In order to add docToolchain as submodule, you just have to execute the following command

    git submodule add git@github.com:docToolchain/docToolchain.git

To checkout the first release version of docToolchain, switch to the submodule and checkout the tag `V1.0.0`

    cd docToolchain
    git checkout tags/V1.0.0
    cd ..

add docToolchain as sub-project to your main project by adding an include to the `settings.gradle` file

    echo "include 'docToolchain'" > settings.gradle

If you now list all tasks of your project, gradle will pic up the docToolchain build file from the subproject,
download all dependencies and output the list of available tasks and fail with an exception:

    ./gradlew tasks

    FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
    * Where:
    Script '/home/docToolchain/tutorial1/docToolchain/scripts/AsciiDocBasics.gradle' line: 25
    * What went wrong:
    A problem occurred evaluating script.
    > ./Config.groovy (No such file or directory)

That's correct -- docToolchain needs a configuration file!

Let's create an empty one and see how this works:

[source, bash, role="primary"]
----
    touch Config.groovy
    ./gradlew tasks
----

et voilÃ¡, you get a list of all available tasks:

[source]
----
> Task :tasks

------------------------------------------------------------
All tasks runnable from root project

To see all tasks and more detail, run gradle tasks --all

To see more detail about a task, run gradle help --task <task>

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 40s
1 actionable task: 1 executed
~/tutorial1$

----

As you can see, you now have already a lot of documentation tasks at hand.

== setting up the configuration

create a simple `Config.groovy` file to start with:

[source, groovy]
----
outputPath = 'build/docs'

// Path where the docToolchain will search for the input files.
// This path is appended to the docDir property specified in gradle.properties
// or in the command line, and therefore must be relative to it.
inputPath = 'src/docs'

inputFiles = [
              [file: 'test.adoc',            formats: ['html','pdf']],
             ]

taskInputsDirs = ["${inputPath}/images"]

taskInputsFiles = []

----

And since we want to use our main project to be the source of the documentation, we have to tell docToolchain where it can find it. Since we don't want to touch the original docToolchain sources, we override the config via the `build.gradle` file.
Just add the following line to your `build.gradle`.
Since we have an empty main project in this tutorial, you can even overwrite the whole `build.gradle` with this line:

[source, groovy]
----
project('docToolchain') { docDir = "../." }
----

This instructs docToolchain to use the main project as starting point for all other configurations (like the one we just defined in `Config.groovy`)
